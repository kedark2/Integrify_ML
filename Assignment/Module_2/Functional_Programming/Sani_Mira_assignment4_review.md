# Sani and Mirazum's assignment review
The link to their assignment is: https://github.com/Slah-Sani/Mirazum_Slah_FP/blob/master/Exercise_pandas_4.ipynb

The objective of this assignment was to teach the proper usage of groupby. They have done their assignment properly. All the codes are readable. One thing what they can improve is on the commenting. The proper commenting helps to understand the code better way. One new thing they have included in the task is PIVOT. This was new thing for us to learn. 

## pandas.pivot_table
Create a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame. The levels in the pivot table will be stored in MultiIndex objects (hierarchical indexes) on the index and columns of the result DataFrame.
